# saeafar-pub-sub-solution_with_topic_names

The Publisher (machine A, IP A) sends the data to a sever (mahine B, IP B) and the subscribers need to run on machine B

THis is a demo script where the case seafar couldn't share their IP address so they send it directly to VS8.

if you want the reverse so subribing on the host with the ip you need to swap the bind and connect in the pub and sub
